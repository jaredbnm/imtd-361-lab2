    <h2>Course Catalog Description:</h2>
    <p>Students in this course will learn the importance of human-computer 
        interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The course will cover a
        survey of methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as usability testing and
        prototyping, as well as general design principles and how to use design guidelines. A
        particular emphasis will be placed on usability for Web site engineering, and students will
        apply knowledge from the field in the design and construction of user-centered Web sites.</p>
    <h2>Course Outcomes:</h2>
    <p>Students completing this course will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe the diversity of information system users and tasks, and their impact on design.</li>
        <li>Describe the core concepts, applicability, and cost benefits of user-centered design.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate how user-centered concerns can be incorporated into system development life
            cycles.</li>
        <li>Explain the need to evaluate system usability.</li>
        <li>Describe and apply general principles of design.</li>
